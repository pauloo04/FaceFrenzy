ðŸ§  Face Frenzy
Face Frenzy is a fast-paced interactive face detection game built using Zynq P2 boards for hardware control and Python for software logic. Designed for real-time engagement, the game challenges players to match a randomly generated face count using actual people in front of a USB camera.

ðŸŽ® Game Overview
The system displays a target number of faces the players must match.

A countdown timer begins.

After the countdown, a frame is captured using a USB camera.

The system uses face detection algorithms to count the number of faces.

If the detected face count matches the target, the player continues.

If it doesnâ€™t match, the player loses one life.

Players have a total of 3 livesâ€”game over if they lose them all!
